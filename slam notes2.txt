kinematics (for)
	a. forward 
  	- given turnAngle, moveDistance
    - find next position coordinates
  	- to get new localised views 
    
  b. inverse
  	- given next position coordinates(p-next), 
    - find turnangle, moveDistance
    - inverse the transformation (step1 reverse transition, step2 reverse rotation)
  	- combine obtained coordinates with global view
    - drifting occurs when forward kinematics, given coordinate != actual coordinate, coordinates maths (Monte Cardo, E-Kalman Filter) to adjust
  
  more sonar sensors (overlapping bit (higher level of trust) for higher accuracy) for larger coverage angle (180) similar to human view angle
  = one laser sensor also 180 angle to 30m
  one sonar sensor emit 30 degree sound cone to 3m (no need overlap because no environmental limitations and own weaknesses)
